    <div>LONDON, <span class='sc'>March 19, 1799</span>.</div>
    <div>At a special Meeting of the Directors of</div>
    <div><i>THE ROYAL HUMANE SOCIETY</i>;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Several of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House
being present; the <span class='sc'>Prize Essays</span>, on
preserving Mariners from Shipwreck, were read;
when the following RESOLUTIONS passed
unanimously:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. <i>That the ingenious Essay which has for its motto,
“Delightful task, to soften human woe,” &#38;c.
is a very able and scientific performance, happily
enlisting Philosophy in the cause of Humanity.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>II. <i>That, as the precautions which it so earnestly impresses
may tend to prevent the fatal disasters of
shipwreck, and to preserve the lives of British seamen,
its publication, especially at this eventful
period, will be peculiarly interesting; and that,
therefore, the permission of the Author be requested.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>III. <i>That, on opening the sealed packet, annexed to
the above mentioned Essay, the Author appears to
be Dr.</i> <span class='sc'>Fothergill</span> <i>of Bath</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since you were pleased to crown my former
Dissertation with your <span class='sc'>Honorary Gold Medal</span>,
I must now, (agreeably to what I long ago hinted,)
beg leave to decline any share in your present
pecuniary premium. In obedience, however, to
your second resolution, respecting the publication
of this Essay, I submit to your superior judgement.
Since it has been honoured with your sanction, I
have re-touched it throughout, in hopes of rendering
it more worthy of your approbation. In
compliance, therefore, with your obliging request,
it now ventures, though not without diffidence, to
meet the public eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the naval force of Great Britain is computed
to consist of not less than eight hundred ships of
war; while her commercial fleets, and trading
vessels of various denominations, surpass those of
all other nations, disasters at sea, particularly at
this juncture, are most seriously to be deprecated.
So great, indeed, is the aggregate value of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>ships, with their respective cargoes and merchandise,
that it can hardly be estimated. Great as it
is, however, it can bear no competition with the
lives of British seamen on board; yet between them
and a watery grave is hourly interposed, only a thin
partition of brittle planks!</p>

<p class='c008'>The present subject, therefore, involving the
lives of thousands of our fellow-subjects, and property
to an amount almost incalculable, is perhaps
one of the most momentous that can, at this
time, engage our attention. When, under the signature
of a Life Director, I first submitted this
question to your consideration, as perfectly congenial
to your life-saving institution, it was chiefly
with a view to call forth the abilities of ingenious
writers and experienced navigators. If the present
Essay should ultimately contribute to so important
a purpose, by opening a new path of inquiry, I
shall think the labour well bestowed.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>No philosophical work written expressly on
shipwreck having yet reached my notice, the
subject to me, appears to be novel, and in a manner
untouched.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The following sketch, undertaken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>amidst a variety of avocations, though
much short of what I could wish, is yet the best
I could produce in so short a time, and with so
few materials.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. In contriving various means of forming a line of communication
with the shore, that some of the methods proposed
by me may have occurred to others, is not improbable,
as has been hinted respecting Mr. Bell’s experiment. Had
the anonymous writer in a late Morning Chronicle, who
claims it as the discovery of another anonymous writer, and
published eight years ago in an Anonymous French Journal,
brought forth any thing <span class='fss'>MORE NEW</span> or <span class='fss'>MORE PRACTICABLE</span>
than what originally appeared in this Essay, when read before
the Society in March last, it would assuredly have afforded
me much pleasure to have announced it.</p>

<p class='c008'>But who the original inventor is, if not Mr. Bell, or in
which of the numerous French Journals the supposed discovery
is recorded, “this <i>deponent saieth not</i>.” Therefore,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>——“<i><span lang="la">Si quid novisti rectius istis,</span></i></div>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="la">Candidus imperti, si non his utere mecum.</span></i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Doubtless the Author may be accused of rashness,
in thus venturing out of his native element,
and in quitting, at once, <i>terra firma</i>, to encounter
the dangers of the deep, and to brave the still
more stormy sea—of criticism!</p>

<p class='c008'>Presuming, however, on your wonted candor,
that you, my Lords of the Admiralty (in other
words, my <span class='sc'>Supreme Judges</span>), will not be extreme
to mark what may seem amiss, I here
cheerfully submit to your inspection, my logbook,
charts, and such implements as appear
necessary to render sea-voyages less perilous, and,
in case of shipwreck, to save the lives and property
of unfortunate mariners in the hour of
distress.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Of all the heavy afflictions incident to a seafaring-life,
shipwreck is the most disastrous. For
what can afford a more affecting spectacle than
those poor way-worn mariners, who, on their
joyful return from a long voyage to the bosom of
their families, are unhappily cast away at the
very mouth of the harbour! To behold them,
in this perilous situation, conflicting with the
merciless waves; clinging to the broken planks,
or with uplifted hands and piercing shrieks imploring
aid with all the eloquence of ineffable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>woe! among the crowd of spectators on the
beach, see the aged parent, the tender wife, and
the helpless children of the distressed sufferers,
bathed in tears, and, in the anguish of their
souls, pouring forth their unavailing cries and
supplications! at length exhausted with ineffectual
strugglings, the devoted victims in the agony
of despair, are forced to yield to the all-conquering
element, and, while casting their last
look on the shore, are suddenly overwhelmed in
one common undistinguished grave!</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, this is no feigned picture of imaginary
distress, but the genuine recital of a mournful
event, which, alas! is too often realised on the
British coasts!</p>

<p class='c008'>An affecting instance of this nature happened
not long ago, in open day, and in the face of at
least a hundred spectators, to two vessels belonging
to Cardigan Bay, which, during a storm,
were unfortunately wrecked near the coast. One
of them, being in a <i>decayed</i> state, sunk within
fifty yards of shore, where the crew, being instantly
cast on a sand bank, miraculously escaped.
But the miserable sufferers in the other vessel,
eleven in number, being unable to keep their
hold, whilst immense billows broke over them,
were washed off one by one, until only one man
was left, who tenaciously kept his seat for two
hours after his unfortunate companions, when a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>prodigious wave dashed the wreck to the shore,
where it unhappily struck against a rock which
forced him back into the foaming surge, and he
was seen no more!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>Second Case of Shipwreck near Shore.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>According to an extract of a letter from
Basseterre, of Aug. 3, 1792, the ship Britannia,
captain Woodyear, with thirty persons, including
two women and a child on board, struck on the
bar near shore, and soon broke to pieces, leaving
the captain with the female passengers and four
men on the wreck; all the rest being washed off,
except a few who escaped by swimming.</p>

<p class='c008'>A boat repeatedly attempted to get off to their
assistance, but in vain. The captain having exerted
every nerve to save the remaining sufferers,
particularly the women and child, was at length
so completely exhausted as to be utterly unable
to prevent their falling a prey to the devouring
waves. He, together with his remaining companions,
soon underwent the same unhappy fate!</p>

<p class='c008'>The gallant captain might have swam on shore
with his brother, but observed, that his quitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the ship would dispirit his people, and that he
could not think of leaving them, particularly the
poor women and child, in so perilous a situation.
Thus did he nobly sacrifice his own life in a fruitless
effort to preserve theirs!</p>

<p class='c008'>The lamentations of the people on shore most
forcibly expressed their sentiments on this truly
distressing event. To increase the horrors of the
scene, the brothers and relations of the unfortunate
captain were among the spectators; while
Mrs. Moore, one of the passengers, was also seen
with her child in her lap, and clinging to her
other son and her brother, wringing her hands in
the wild agony of despair, while her disconsolate
friends on land were unable to afford them the
smallest assistance! Next morning the beach was
covered with dead bodies that had been cast on
shore in the night!</p>

amore</i> by the ingenious captain Falconer, who, having narrowly
escaped from a similar disaster, paints the affecting
scene from nature.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h3 class='c014'><i>Attended with peculiar circumstances.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Captain M‘Kay, in a late pamphlet addressed
to his father, gives some interesting particulars
respecting the shipwreck of the Juno, of
which he was the second officer. The ship, he
remarks, was <i>crazy</i>, and greatly out of repair,
before she set out from Rangoon, bound to Madras.
This circumstance appears to have been the source
of their subsequent misfortunes. For the vessel,
being unequal to sustain the violence of the storm
which overtook them on their voyage, became
leaky, and was cast away on the coast; when the
principal part of the crew miserably perished.
Out of seventy-two persons on board, Captain
M‘Kay, with thirteen companions, only survived.
But, strange to relate (for the fact, were it not
so well attested, would appear almost incredible),
this unhappy remnant of the crew, being left on
the wreck, subsisted not less than twenty-three
days without food!</p>

<p class='c008'>In describing their unparalleled sufferings during
this forlorn situation, Captain M‘Kay observes,
that the sense of hunger was very tormenting till
the fifth day, when it gave way to the still more
distressing sensation of extreme thirst. These
painful sensations, however, were greatly mitigated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>whenever rain fell copiously, and wet them
through their clothes. But, finding the relief only
temporary, he had recourse to such other expedients
as were at hand.—Sea-water drank liberally,
though it operated as a severe purgative, yet afforded
considerable refreshment. He next chewed
pieces of lead, procured from fragments of the
wreck, which, by producing a fresh flow of saliva,
alleviated the intense thirst. To silence the cravings
arising from that aching void produced by
long fasting, and which nothing but nutritious
food can fully satisfy, he tried the experiment of
forcibly compressing the region of the stomach
with both hands, which always afforded immediate
relief. Hardened and benumbed with their
sufferings, his unhappy comrades seemed to feel
very little concern or sympathy one for another.</p>

<p class='c008'>The idea every now and then of hearing a gun,
or seeing a sail, when found only to be an illusion,
never failed to embitter their distress. When
they gave up life as utterly lost, they expressed
less anguish; a state of cruel suspense being more
painful than absolute despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>The preceding melancholy cases of shipwreck
are selected from several others, if possible, still
more deplorable; over which, however, to spare
the sympathetic feelings of the humane Reader, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>shall draw the friendly veil. These already related
are sufficient to suggest a variety of reflections;
and it seemed necessary to give them in
detail, as they may afford some useful inferences
for the benefit of future navigators.</p>

<p class='c013'>It appears then, in conformity to what has been
already observed, that accidents from shipwreck
happen most frequently near shore; and that
communication between the distressed vessel and
the coast being cut off, prevents that timely aid
which might otherwise be administered.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. That the crazy state of a ship, previous to
the voyage, must inevitably increase the danger,
and hasten on the fatal catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. That sailors expert in the art of swimming
frequently escape, while their helpless companions
miserably perish.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. That life may sometimes be supported without
food the space of twenty-three days; a much
longer period than is commonly supposed, and
which can only be explained on the principle of
absorption. Hence the refreshment experienced
by Captain M‘Kay and his companions from their
bodies being wet with rain. Hence also the relief
which Captain Bligh and his men, in their late
surprizing voyage, obtained, not only from exposure
to rain, but also from immersing their
clothes in the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The cause of this singular effect seems to be
this: The innumerable lymphatic ducts, opening
every where over the whole surface of the skin,
exert their absorbent power in proportion to the
demand. Here, the sailors’ bodies being exhausted
by long fasting, and nature reduced to her <i>dernier</i>
resource, the lymphatic system imbibed
with avidity the water, but rejected the salt;
otherwise the extreme thirst, instead of being
mitigated, would have been greatly increased.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. It further appears, from Captain M‘Kay’s
observation, that the painful sensation of extreme
hunger may be greatly alleviated by compressing
the region of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. That this distressing symptom goes off about
the fifth day, and gives way to intense thirst,
which, in its turn, may also be mitigated by
chewing lead, as practised by sailors, in hot
climates, who assuage their thirst by rolling in
their mouths a leaden bullet. The poisonous
quality of the metal, however, renders this a
doubtful expedient. To allay thirst, and support
the system, Dr. Franklin, with more propriety, had
recourse to bathing in sea-water several hours every
day, and observed that, however thirsty he was
before immersion, he never continued so afterwards:
nor did he ever perceive in his mouth any
taste of saltness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>In case of extreme scarcity of fresh water, in
long voyages, sailors, he remarks, might derive
similar advantage by dipping their wearing apparel
in the sea, and that without the least danger
of cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. That life may be protracted many weeks
by mere water alone, will appear less wonderful
when it is considered, that water consists of vital
and inflammable air, and most probably undergoes
a decomposition in the human frame; that
its vital portion renews and invigorates the living
principle, while its inflammable part supplies nutrition.
For it can scarcely be doubted, that marine
reptiles and fishes, that can subsist on water
alone, are endowed with a power of decomposing
it, and converting the inflammable part to their
nourishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence, the swarms of insects in hot climates
where inflammable air is copiously generated from
putrid substances. Like plants, they thrive amidst
putrefaction; convert the noxious effluvia into
sustenance; and reject the vital air destined to
sustain breathing animals. Were it not for this
wise provision, the pernicious effluvia would, in
such climates, prove a fruitful source of pestilence,
and render a large portion of the globe
uninhabitable.</p>

<p class='c008'>On emergencies, therefore, when fresh water
is wanting, sea-water, under proper management,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>may afford a better substitute than is generally
imagined.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here it deserves notice, that water may be preserved
sweet, during the longest voyage, by the
following simple process. Having filled the cask
with water in which quick-lime is quenched, let
it stand till the inside of the cask has acquired a
thin coat of lime; then rinse out the cask, and
re-fill it with fresh water for the voyage, adding a
few handfuls of recent charcoal dust, a portion of
which may be also kept for use in a bottle tight-corked.
It not only preserves water sweet, but
even restores putrid or corrupt water, which only
requires afterwards to be filtered. This, and all
other extraneous substances contained in water,
not by <i>solution</i>, but <i>diffussion</i> only, may be
most expeditiously separated by Mr. Peacock’s
Patent Machine, which has been found, by
experiment, to filter 720 gallons of water in
twenty-four hours, divesting it of all such accidental
impurities. This invention promises much
utility to persons by land, as well as by sea, and
may be seen at the Surveyor’s Office, Guildhall,
London.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. To prevent in future voyages the terrible
calamity of famine at sea, portable soup and
farinaceous vegetables ought to constitute part of
the ship’s provisions. To assuage the sensation of
hunger, and enable the body to bear long fasting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>oleaginous substances are well adapted, as beef and
mutton suet, rich cheese, fresh butter, sweet almonds,
also mucilaginous substances, as salop,
tapioca, and particularly gum arabic, which, according
to M. Hasselquist, supported more than
one thousand persons in the desarts of Arabia,
who, being left destitute of other provisions, subsisted
upon it solely during the space of two
months.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. The treatment of shipwrecked mariners when
nearly exhausted by cold and hunger, demands
no small circumspection. At first they loath the
sight of meat; but on a sudden the appetite grows
voracious, and prompts them to devour more food
than the digestive organs can assimilate. Their
native warmth also, being greatly impaired,
should be very gradually restored by a tepid
bath; and the food should consist of new milk,
barley-water, or weak broth, in very small quantity,
which, in this state of more than infantile debility,
will be found sufficiently powerful; avoiding,
at the same time, the common error of pouring
down wine, spirits, or other stimulating cordials,
which, instead of supporting life, too often
exhaust the feeble remnant of vitality<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><span class='sc'>Causes of Storms and Shipwrecks</span>—<i>whether influenced by local circumstances</i>.—</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The most obvious cause of shipwreck, according
to the language of seamen, is a heavy
gale of wind with a lee shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the tides are produced by the joint influence
of the sun and moon, the stormy waves
depend wholly on winds of the higher order.
Air possesses not only a chemical but mechanical
attraction for water, superior to that which obtains
between the component parts of the latter.
When air, therefore, rapidly sweeps along the
surface of water, it forcibly seizes the upper stratum,
and raises it aloft in a surprizing manner,
until the water, by its superior gravity, suddenly
recovers its level. This powerful action and reaction
between the contending elements constitutes
a sea storm, which, according to its violence,
raises the billows from twelve to twenty feet,
sometimes to a much greater altitude, as in tornadoes
and hurricanes, when the sea (as the sailors
express it) runs mountains high.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, hurricanes may proceed from local rarefaction,
or whatever suddenly disturbs the equilibrium
of the atmosphere, but principally from
an accumulation of the electrical fluid, which has
a powerful tendency towards pointed or angular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>bodies to restore the balance. Hence, perhaps,
it is, that lofty promontories, high cliffs, and
rocky projecting shores, are so often infested with
violent storms, while the main sea remains calm
and unruffled. In such situations, the effects of
the warring elements are often dreadful, and the
disasters produced amongst the neighbouring vessels
truly deplorable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of a tempest at sea, Thompson gives the following
sublime and picturesque description:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then comes the Father of the Tempest forth</div>
      <div class='line'>Wrapt in black glooms——</div>
      <div class='line'>Lash’d into foam, the fierce conflicting brine</div>
      <div class='line'>Seems o’er a thousand raging waves to burn;</div>
      <div class='line'>Mean time, the mountain billows to the clouds</div>
      <div class='line'>In direful tumult swell’d—surge after surge,</div>
      <div class='line'>Burst into chaos, with tremendous roar!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>They boil and wheel and foam and thunder thro’</div>
      <div class='line'>And anchor’d navies from their station drive!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Along the British and other neighbouring
coasts, the equinoctial storms are generally the
most formidable. As these are to be expected at
their respective seasons, all prudent navigators
ought to provide against their periodical return.</p>

<p class='c008'>In tropical climates, and along the abrupt
coasts of the Leeward Islands, the most violent
hurricanes prevail between the 25th of July and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the latter end of September, the wind blowing
from the N. or N. W. in direct opposition to the
trade winds.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>Prognostic signs of a Hurricane.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The native Carribees of St. Dominica and St.
Vincent, from long observation, can with surprizing
accuracy foretell the approach of the hurricane
ten or twelve days before it arrives,—a
circumstance of no small moment to inexperienced
navigators.</p>

<p class='c008'>All hurricanes, they observe, happen about the
period of the lunations, particularly at full moon,
and may be predicted from the following signs:</p>

<p class='c008'>1st. The sun exhibits a blood-like redness.—The
moon surrounded with a halo, the stars with
a bur, and seem larger than usual.—The sky, towards
the N. W. dark and gloomy.—Wells and
deep caverns send forth a hollow sound.—The
sea, an unusual rank odor.—Mists disappear on the
tops of mountains—a calm succeeds—when on a
sudden the hurricane bursts forth with incredible
impetuosity, twists trees asunder, dismasts
ships, and drives them a-shore, sometimes above
twenty yards beyond the water-mark!</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the wind veers from N. W. to E.
or S. E. the hurricane ceases; yet, what is
remarkable, the raging of the waves continues and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>even increases in proportion to the <i>momentum</i> of
the impulse already acquired, till at length, the
tempest having spent its fury, the billows subside,
and the sea gradually resumes its former tranquillity.
Hence may be also understood, why the
tide continues to flow at least forty-eight hours
after the full and change; its altitude at Bristol
often amounting to forty-seven feet, or upwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides tempests at sea, including hurricanes,
thunder storms, and water-spouts, there are still
other causes which too often produce shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sea-faring men, inured to hardships, and taught
by example to despise dangers, are often totally
regardless of forecast, and even of the necessary
means of self-preservation. To unpardonable
negligence, or fool-hardiness, therefore, rather
than to unavoidable misfortune, may many of
their disasters be justly imputed. To what else
can be attributed the entire loss of the Royal
George, and of the Haswell, with their respective
companies? or of the late tremendous explosion
of the La Coquille? and other still more recent
disasters?</p>

<p class='c008'>From the master down to the common tar, the
same <i>nonchallence</i>, the same contempt of danger,
frequently pervades the whole crew. Thus, when
the master embarks on board a decayed leaky vessel
unfit to bear stress of weather; when the
sleepy pilot, dozing at the helm, runs the ship on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>some noted rock or lee-shore; or, when the
drunken sailor, with a lighted candle, carelessly
approaches too near a cask of spirits, or gunpowder;
what in the name of wonder can be expected
but inevitable ruin! Under such management, can
we be surprised that fatal accidents befal so many
of our trading vessels, not only in long voyages,
but even in making a short trip across the channel?
It was by a very different conduct, guided by
prudence and marked by unremitting attention,
that Captain Cook, and other expert circum-navigators,
performed their successful voyages round
the globe; and that Captain Bligh, in an open
boat amidst frequent storms, traversed the great
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>Hints for improving naval architecture.—For rendering boats incapable of upsetting or sinking.—The Life-Boat at Shields—its singular utility.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Though shipwreck, under certain circumstances,
perhaps, cannot by any human means be
prevented; yet there seems reason to hope it may,
in future, be rendered less frequent and less fatal,
by observing the subsequent precautions.</p>

    </dl>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>1st. From late discoveries respecting floating
bodies, and a comparative view of the ships of
different nations, the board of naval architecture
will, it is hoped, be enabled to suggest many useful
improvements in the construction of all kinds
of vessels, and by well conducted experiments to
reduce the art of ship-building to a more regular
science.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the interim, let ships of every denomination,
previous to the intended voyage, undergo
a more strict examination by competent and impartial
judges, that such as are materially damaged
or worn out be condemned, and none permitted
to sail unless they can be safely warranted.</p>

<p class='c013'>2dly. Let tall-masted vessels and ships of burthen
be well armed with electrical conductors.
For though it be beyond human power to arrest
the rapid lightning in its flight, yet reason, enlightened
by experimental philosophy, has taught
us how to divest it of a considerable part of its
terrors, by the use of metallic rods. But, in order
to prevent their being melted by the lightning,
let a pointed piece of black lead be inserted
at their tops, projecting about two inches
above the metallic sockets; and to guard them
against rust, which would destroy their conducting
power, let the rods be sheathed with tin or
copper.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>3dly. To render ships more durable with less
expence of timber, it has been lately recommended,
by Mr. Bosquet, to fill up all the void
spaces between the planks, lining, and timbers,
with a composition of melted pitch, tar, and glue,
adding a certain quantity of cork-shavings and
charcoal dust. This not only prevents rats harbouring
in the cavities, but also the accumulation
of bilge water and foul air, so highly injurious
to mariners. Ships thus fortified by his
patent invention, being rendered sound and durable,
would, he imagines, rarely be subject to
leakage or foundering at sea<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>

<p class='c008'>In the construction of ships, for safety as well
as swiftness, Sir George Shee advises to add to
their length and width, and to diminish considerably
their height. By reversing this, and by
crowding too much sail, light vessels and pleasure
barges become unfit to encounter sudden gusts of
wind, and are frequently upset.</p>

<p class='c013'>4thly. To prevent accidents of this nature, Mr.
Miller of Dalswinton, in his specification of a
patent invention of a vessel for passengers or parties
of pleasure, incapable of being upset, proposes
his flat-bottomed boat, which draws very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>little water. It moves with wheels in the water,
wrought by capstans; roomy between decks for
the accommodation of numerous passengers, and
requires no pumps<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The seamen of Trinity House, at Leith, recommend,
for safety, a boat carrying more ballast
than necessary for ordinary sailing; over the
ballast, bags filled with cork, rising higher than
the gunnels; the whole properly secured by sailcloth
and ropes. By this contrivance, they alledge,
that all persons on board, or even others
holding by the boat; will be carried safe through
the most stormy breakers. On similar principles,
and to answer the same end, other boats have been
constructed by ingenious persons in America, in
Italy, and in Holland. The patent boat of Mr.
Lukin, coachmaker, in London, which, we are
told, can neither overset, nor sink, though filled
with water, is formed with projecting gunnales,
sloping from the top, armed with cork; and secured
with leather or tin. Of which a more full
description is given in the “Repertory of Arts,”
vol. III. p. 10.</p>

<p class='c008'>Count Berchtold, of Tuscany, well known for
his zeal in the cause of humanity, not long ago
presented to the Society for the Encouragement of
Arts, in London, a curious model of a boat, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>necessary apparatus for assisting persons in danger
of drowning, by the breaking of ice, which may
be viewed at the Society’s rooms, in the Adelphi,
by application to the secretary.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Greenlanders have invented a boat of a
singular construction, resembling a huge inflated
bladder, inveloped with seal skins, and rendered
water-proof, in which they can sit at ease, while
they ply their oars, and thus encounter their
stormy seas in perfect safety. One of these boats
may be seen in the British Museum; or an accurate
description with an engraving, in the first
volume of Crantz’s History of Greenland.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>The</i> <span class='sc'>Life-Boat</span>, <i>at Shields.—Its singular Utility evinced by repeated Trials.</i>—</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This noted boat, by which, within the course
of a few years, many lives and much property
have been saved, was built by Mr. Greathead,
an able ship-builder, and generously presented to
the inhabitants of South Shields by his Grace
the Duke of Northumberland, by whose beneficence
North Shields has also since been supplied
with a boat of a similar construction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Fairless, who furnished some useful hints
respecting the original plan, describes the vessel
“as measuring 30 feet by 10; resembling, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>form, a common Greenland boat, only flatter in
the bottom. The weight of cork employed in the
construction is about 7 <i>cwt</i>, with which the boat
is lined, inside and outside of the gunnales, two
feet in breadth; the seats being also filled with
the same: rowed by ten men, double-banked,
and steered by one at each end with oars, being
alike at both ends, and with a contrivance to prevent
sinking in the sand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She draws very little water, and can carry
twenty persons, even when full of water. Being
water-proof, and rendered buoyant by cork, she
keeps afloat, preserving her equilibrium without
danger of oversetting, and is able to contend
against the most tremendous sea, having never in
any one instance yet failed of conveying a distressed
ship’s crew into safety.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In going off with her, in the highest seas and
broken water, the men testify no dread; and,
though cork jackets were provided for them, yet
such is their confidence in the boat, that they
now refuse to use them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed, she has surprised every intelligent
seaman that has seen her contend with the boisterous
waves. Any farther description I can give,”
adds Mr. Fairless, “will not be equal to a view
of the model kept at Northumberland House, in
London, which, I make no doubt, you may see.
Such a vessel ought to be provided with high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>wheels, to convey it to the place where it is immediately
wanted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The boat complete, and copper-nailed, cost
about 150<i>l.</i>” But, in the moment of distress,
what shipwrecked mariner would not think this
a cheap purchase, and pronounce the value of such
a boat as truly inestimable!</p>

    <div>[<i>From American and Batavian correspondence.</i>]</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>1. An expert American seaman recommends
to mariners the experiment of hanging out a line
of cable over the stern of a small vessel, or boat,
in a rough sea, as this appendage serves to make
a long wake, and will be found to enable the
vessel (according to the sea term) to live much
longer in a heavy gale. Little danger, he observes,
is to be apprehended from a long sweeping
swell of the sea; the mischief generally arises
from overhanging surges, which at once break
in and overwhelm the vessel. Having often experienced,
in stormy weather, the beneficial effects
of a long coil of rope fixed to a flat piece
of wood, and appended to vessels, he thence endeavours
to explain the extraordinary efficacy of
the tow-line in balancing the ship, and lowering
the high-swelling surge.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>2. From the Transactions of the Philosophical
Society, at Philadelphia, we learn, that Mr. Hopkinson
has invented an instrument, with a graduated
tube, which, from the difference of specific
gravity between oil and water, by its rise
and fall, accurately measures the ship’s progress.
Also, a curious spring block, by which sailing is
greatly expedited; for which useful invention he
obtained the Society’s gold medal.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Mr. Gearson, of York-town, Pennsilvania,
has lately obtained a patent for an important invention,
by means of which, we are informed,
that a vessel whose bottom is so shattered, that the
ordinary pumps could not, for one hour, prevent
her sinking, will be effectually kept buoyant;
and, though under a press of sail, be incapable of
being overset by the heaviest gale.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. A gentleman of Rotterdam has invented a
new floating machine, which, though small, is
capable of holding four men commodiously, and
may be enlarged sufficiently to accommodate
fifty, if required. So curious is its construction,
we are told, as to enable it to withstand the utmost
fury of the winds and seas. It can neither
overset, nor sink, and may therefore, in the most
stormy weather, be steered whatever course the
pilot shall see necessary. These last may be considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>as different modifications of the life-boat,
constructed with the same humane views, though
probably without any communication between
the respective artists. Were packet-boats destined
to convey important dispatches thus constructed,
many unfortunate accidents might be
prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'>The comparative value of these and other laudable
inventions, whether produced by foreigners,
or our own countrymen, must rest with their ingenious
authors, at least, till their respective merits
be fully ascertained by actual experiment.
Were models of every new and useful contrivance,
of this nature, consigned to the board of
Naval Architecture, for public inspection, the display
of such an assemblage of mechanism would
excite emulation, and the result of satisfactory
trials, if communicated from time to time, might
prove highly important to the maritime world.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><i>To ascertain the ship’s burthen.</i></h3>

<p class='c015'>5. It is certain, that a ship will carry a weight
equal to that of a quantity of water, of the same
bulk with itself, deducting, however, the weight
of metal employed in its construction; for the
wood is nearly of the same weight with water.
Were it not for the iron, or other metal, a ship
might float though full of water. However it be
loaded, therefore, it will not entirely sink as long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>as the weight of its cargo is less than that of an
equal bulk of water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, to ascertain this, the capacity of the
ship must be measured. Suppose it to be 1000
cubical feet, multiply that by 73 pounds, the
average weight of a cubical foot of sea-water
(taken at a proper distance from shore), which
gives in the product 73,000 pounds for the
weight of a bulk of water equal to that of the
ship, the burthen of the ship being 73,000
pounds, or 36 ton and a half, reckoning a ton
2000 pounds, that being the weight of a ton  of
sea-water. If the cargo exceeds 36 ton and half,
the ship will sink; if just 73,000 pounds, she
will swim, though very deep in the water, and on
the very point of sinking. And though she may
float at sea, she will sink on entering the mouth of
a river; fresh water being specifically lighter
than sea-water, and in the proportion of about 63
to 73.</p>

<p class='c008'>Previous to the voyage, therefore, the ship’s
burthen ought to be more carefully ascertained
than, perhaps, raw inexperienced navigators have
hitherto imagined.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><i>The ship’s pumps.</i></h3>

<p class='c015'>6. The pumps ought to be formed on the most
approved plan, and kept in perfect order. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>prefer Mr. Fulton’s patent pump, worked by a
cylinder, and described in the Repertory of Arts,
vol. III.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Clarke, Surgeon, at Sunderland, proposes
an easier and more expeditious method of working
the pumps, by means of a curved lever, which
acts by an easy motion of the body, as in rowing.
It has been found, on trial, to deliver twice
the quantity of water, and with far less labour,
than that with the brake—a circumstance of no
small consequence, especially when seamen are
almost worn out with sickness or fatigue<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. See Repertory, Vol. IX.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Dearborn, an ingenious American mechanic,
has accomplished a still farther improvement,
by constructing a new machine to answer the
double purpose of a pump and a fire-engine<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. Ibid. Vol. III.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Taylor, of Southampton, we are credibly
informed, has invented a ship pump, which, in
point of simplicity and ingenuity, surpasses all
others, and bids fair to supersede them in the
British navy.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><i>Ship’s compass.</i></h3>

<p class='c015'>7. The magnetic power of the mariner’s compass
is liable to be disturbed by various accidents,
as the rolling of the ship in a rough sea, the
explosion of the great guns, and particularly
lightning. Nay, even the electricity of the glass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>cover, when excited by the slightest accidental
friction, is sufficient to alter its direction;
but this can be soon remedied by wetting
the glass, which carries off the electricity. In
thunder storms at sea, the polarity of the needle
has sometimes been suddenly reversed, and irreparably
damaged, by the North and South points
changing their station, occasioning, at the same
time, dangerous errors. By this accident, a ship
has been known to take a retrograde course, and
steer above 100 leagues by a needle, the polarity
of which had thus been totally changed<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. Phil. Trans. Abridged, by Lowthorp, vol. II. p. 180.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The compass, though long known, was imperfect
and liable to many inconveniencies, till at length,
by the ingenuity of Dr. Knight, it was greatly improved;
and has since undergone a further emendation
by Mr. Smeaton. The improvement consists
in the shape and temper of the needle; in the discovery
of proper means for restoring the loss of
magnetism in a voyage; and, finally, in rendering
it less subject to be influenced by the motions
of the ship. These contrivances, though found
too delicate always to sustain with impunity the
rude shocks of a tempestuous sea, or the more
violent stroke of lightning, are, however, the
best that have been yet discovered. Therefore, as
this improved compass is allowed to be superior
to others, and is now generally used in the royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>navy, it ought certainly to be provided for all
merchant ships, particularly on long voyages.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><i>Ship’s Rudder.</i></h3>

<p class='c015'>8. The power of the rudder being reducible to
that of the lever, and oblique action of the water,
the most advantageous angle made by the
helm from the keel, mathematicians have fixed
at 54° 44′. Euler recommends an obliquity somewhat
less; and establishes this rule, that an obliquity
of 48° will, in general, produce the most
powerful effect; though experience testifies, that
a ship steers tolerably well when the rudder makes
an angle of only 35°.</p>

<p class='c008'>A convenient substitute for the loss of a rudder
has been invented by captain Pakenham, for
which useful device the Society of Arts presented
him with a gold medal. The method,
being described at large in the Society’s Transactions,
need not be repeated in this place.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><i>Masts.</i></h3>

<p class='c015'>9. To the mechanical genius of captain Pakenham,
the navy is also indebted for an easy, cheap,
and expeditious, method of restoring a mast,
when injured, or decayed, by simply inverting
the mast and turning the heel to the head; of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>which the Society, in the 10th volume of their
Transactions, have given a full description, illustrated
with an engraving.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sudden damage which masts frequently
sustain from sea-storms and naval engagements,
and which, in the ordinary way, require from
six to eight weeks to refit, may thus, we are assured,
be repaired within forty-eight hours; and
that this method is equally applicable to all
ships, from a first-rate, to the smallest merchantman—a
matter of no small consequence on long
voyages, or in time of war.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><i>Nautical Apparatus.</i></h3>

<p class='c015'>10. A ship, properly equipped for a long
voyage, ought to be provided with a complete
set of nautical instruments, including an accurate
thermometer, barometer, and time-piece. Also,
a life-boat, cork jackets, cords, drags, buoys,
and other implements for the prevention of
drowning.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><i>Thermometer.</i></h3>

<p class='c015'>From the result of three successive voyages
from Europe to America, captain Williams, under
the direction of Dr. Franklin, found the temperature
of the main ocean, out of soundings, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>least ten degrees warmer than in shallower water
near the coast. Hence the thermometer may
serve a new and important purpose in pointing out
the near approach to shore; also, in detecting latent
rocks, or banks of sand or coral, concealed
under water. Is the decrease of temperature
owing to these solid bodies acting as conductors,
and thus conveying off the heat?</p>

<h3 class='c014'><i>Nautical Time-piece.</i></h3>

<p class='c015'>A curious and unsuspected cause of inaccuracy
in watches, or time-pieces, has lately been discovered
by an ingenious artist, which well deserves
notice. The balance, being made of steel,
is very liable to acquire a polarity, which disturbs
the regularity of its movement, according
as the watch happens to be placed North and
South, or in the vicinity of a knife, a key, or
other steel utensil. On trying a variety of steel
balances, by floating them on cork, placed on
the surface of water, Mr. Varley could scarcely
select one that did not betray some sign of polarity;
nor can this be easily prevented, but by
substituting a balance of gold, or some other
metal. May not this be one reason why that
grand <i>desideratum</i>, a perfectly correct time-piece
for discovering the longitude at sea, has not yet
been produced?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>To prevent accidents during long voyages, the
Transactions of the Royal Society of London
suggest many important hints; which, however,
for the sake of brevity, must be omitted, by referring
the reader to the respective passages, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>1. To preserve vessels from the worm, by a

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>Hints respecting the Conduct of the Captain and his Mates.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Having briefly discussed the principal objects
respecting the state of the ship, and the precautions
necessary to be taken previous to the
voyage, we now proceed humbly to suggest a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>few hints proper to be observed by the master
and his mates.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Having provided all the requisites necessary
to the complete equipment of the vessel, it becomes
the master to use every necessary precaution
against disasters, and to be prepared to meet
the event whatever it may be.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Like the intrepid captain Riou, and the
gallant and humane captain Woodyear, he should
resolve, in case of distress, to preserve discipline
through the whole scene, and to discharge his
duty by being the last man to quit the shattered
vessel. By thus manfully preserving his authority,
good order will be kept up till, possibly,
some timely aid may be obtained, or the ship
got into harbour. But if in the time of danger
he quit his post, from that moment discipline is at
an end, anarchy prevails, and ruin ensues.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. His shipmates, and whole company under his
command, in their several departments, must
cheerfully obey his orders, and with alacrity give
every possible assistance in the management of the
vessel, and in affording one another mutual aid.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. In the critical hour of distress, to prevent
the additional danger of strife, or mutiny, let the
captain resolve to prevent intoxication. Should
this prove impracticable, let him order every cask
of spirits to be staved.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Dr. Franklin’s experiment of smoothing the
rough undulations of a fresh water-lake to the extent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of half an acre, by pouring on its surface a
small portion of oil, is extremely curious, though
its efficacy in calming the waves of a troubled sea,
as recorded by Pliny, certainly wants confirmation.
By suffering the wind to glide over it, as
over a surface of ice, it seems rather calculated to
prevent new waves forming, than to controul
those already formed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nevertheless, Count Bentinck, in the sixty-fourth
volume of the Philosophical Transactions,
gives a remarkable case, attested by the officers
on board, respecting a Dutch East India ship,
which was happily preserved in a storm by gradually
pouring into the sea a considerable quantity
of Olive Oil. Merchant ships, with large
cargoes of oil, might easily put this matter to the
test. At all events, empty casks, in case of
shipwreck, being well secured between decks,
the air they contain may, in proportion to the
space they occupy, tend to keep the vessel afloat;
or, casks bound to rafts may afford seasonable
means of saving those persons who cannot swim.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. In tropical climates, and particularly in the
Leeward Islands, the signs already mentioned,
which precede the most dreadful hurricanes, several
days before their arrival, if duly attended to
in time, may enable the master not only to foretell
the storm, but to ward off the impending
danger. Convinced of this by long observation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that experienced seaman Captain Langford recommends
the following precautions: “To keep
the ship sailable with store of ballast—ports well
barred and caulked—top-masts down—yards
a-part laced—doors and windows well secured.
Let all ships at anchor quit the road, or they
will be driven a-shore. As the storm always
begins at North and North-West, till it comes
to South-East, when its fury subsides; let them
run to the South for ample sea-room, and for
drift of <i>the</i> South West, and there wait the
event.” Observing these cautions, he providentially
weathered out five dreadful hurricanes without
the loss of sail, yard, or mast. Other commanders,
he adds, who listened to his predictions
and followed his advice, likewise escaped damage,
and returned safe<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. Phil. Trans. Abr. Vol. II. p. 105.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>7. Where the violence of the tempest baffles
all human forecast, and the shattered vessel ready
to sink becomes totally unmanageable, when
signals of distress have been repeated in vain; and
when terror and dismay hang on every countenance,
it requires no common share of fortitude
in the Commander to act with that coolness, prudence,
and promptitude, which the exigency of
the case so evidently demands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shipwreck being inevitable, it behoves him to
exert himself to save as many lives as he possibly
can, by a spirited and impartial conduct,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and by a proper distribution of the cork waistcoats,
ropes, implements, and whatever may seem
useful; to guard against the boats being suddenly
over-crowded, and also to be watchful on
such critical occasions, that men apparently dead
from drowning, or other accidents, be not hastily
thrown overboard, until suitable means of recovery
have failed, or life be totally extinguished<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. The mode of treatment has been already fully discussed.
See New Inquiry on Vital Suspension, Edit. 3. and Preservative
Plan annexed, page 40. on premature burial.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Captain having thus discharged his duty,
and exerted every effort to extricate his comrades
from their calamity, though without the smallest
prospect of success, nothing now remains but that
he, as becomes a helpless mortal, commit himself
and crew to the protection of Him “who rides
in the whirlwind, and directs the storm”—who can
say to the raging sea, “Hitherto shalt thou go,
and no farther; and here shall thy proud waves
be stayed.” Impressed with sentiments of this
nature, so congenial to the mind of a dependent
being, particularly in the hour of distress, Captain
Falconer, in the true spirit of devotion, bursts
forth into the following beautiful apostrophe:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O! <span class='sc'>Source of Life</span>, our Refuge and our Stay!</div>

      <div class='line'>Thy mercy supplicate,—if doom’d to die:</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps this storm is sent, with healing breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>From neighb’ring shores—to scourge disease and death.”</div>
      <div class='line in44'><cite>Shipwreck.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>8. When a vessel is cast away, within a small
distance of shore (as in the late melancholy accidents,
which gave rise to these reflections), the
country people hasten in crowds to view the affecting
spectacle; some with an eager desire to
assist the wretched sufferers; others, (horrible to
relate!) for the sole purpose of plunder! In order
to prevent the cruel depredations of those inhuman
barbarians, a peace-officer ought always to
be present, attended by the principal inhabitants;
and assisted, if required, by a military force<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>He should be empowered to offer premiums for
the preservation of life and property, and to encourage
watermen to face the boisterous sea in
life-boats kept ready for the purpose. But on
these mournful occasions, the minds of the more
humane and civilized spectators are generally too
much agitated to supply the aid that is so much
wanted, or to suggest any means of succour, but
such as are totally inadequate. Nor is this to be
wondered at: the moment of danger is not the
moment of reflection, nor can new resources be
struck out without the rare and happy talent of
invention, and the cool reasoning of a mind at
ease. From want of a life-boat, and other necessary
expedients, how often are ships and their
cargoes irretrievably lost, which otherwise might
have been saved!</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. According to the ancient law, goods cast on shore by
the waves belonged to the King: but the rigour of this law
has since been wisely mitigated in favour of the distressed
proprietors: and it is now held, that, not only if any living
animal escape, but if proof can be made of the property of
any of the goods cast on shore, within a year and a day, they
shall not be forfeited as a legal wreck, but kept in the custody
of the Sheriff, during that period, unless previously claimed
by the proprietor. If the goods be of a perishable nature,
the Sheriff may sell them, and the purchase-money shall be
liable in their stead.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Whoever shall secret any goods from a wreck shall forfeit
treble their value. To steal even a plank from a ship in
distress, says Judge Blackstone, renders the party liable to answer
for the whole vessel and cargo.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Whoever perpetrates any wilful act, by which the ship
is lost, or plunders the vessel in distress, or prevents the
escape of any of the sufferers, or hangs out false lights, to
decoy a vessel into danger, is declared by the law to be guilty
of a capital felony, without benefit of clergy.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. It is also enacted, that all head officers on the coast shall,
on application being made to them, instantly summon as many
persons as are necessary to the relief of any ship in distress,
on forfeiture of one hundred pounds. And, in case of due
assistance given, salvage shall be paid by the owners, to be assessed
by the neighbouring justices.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. The income of wrecks being generally granted by the
King to the Lord of the Manor, as a royal franchise, is seldom,
it is hoped, rigorously claimed, but rather given up to
the distressed sufferers. Such claims, however, might be easily
compromised, as the right owner, if discovered any time
within a full twelvemonth, can supersede the Lord of the
Manor, or any other claimant, and by virtue of this law
recover his property.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><i>Hints for conveying Assistance to a Ship in distress, by forming a line of communication with the shore.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>With what ease a large log of timber, or other
heavy body, may be floated along the surface of
water, by only a moderate-sized cord attached to
it, is well known.</p>

<p class='c008'>Could means once be contrived of conveying
such a cord to or from a ship in distress, to form
a line of communication between the mast and a
fixed point on shore, one grand difficulty would
be surmounted. For to this line of communication
might be fixed collateral cords, which being
conveyed to the sufferers, grasping the broken
planks, or struggling in the waves, many lives
might probably be saved.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, were the line sufficiently strong, and made
to pass through a metallic cylinder, in form of a
sliding hoop, the ship’s crew might, one by one, if
placed thereon, slide along the rope from the mast
to the shore, as on an inclined plane. The ship’s
stores, buckled to the sliding hoop, might be
conveyed in the same manner; nay, even the
ship itself, drifted on a neighbouring sand bank,
or ledge of rocks, might, by men properly stationed
on the beach, be thus towed safely to
shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>That this might be safely accomplished during
a calm, can scarcely be doubted: but how to convey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>a line to or from the ship when all communication
is cut off by a boisterous sea, and “when
not even a boat dare venture out,” must give us
pause, and at first view appear impracticable.—Dangerous
as such an enterprize may seem, yet we
now know, that a life-boat built on scientific principles,
and manned with a few resolute tars, is fully
adequate to the task; such a boat, however, being
yet little known, and no where to be met with,
except at Shields, recourse must be had to other
measures. Those who have duly considered the
theory of projectiles, will be best qualified to
judge how far the following conjectures, when
matured by experience, may bring to light new
modes of deliverance.</p>

<p class='c008'>1st, Suppose the distance not to exceed two hundred
yards, might not a small cord of that length
be transmitted from the ship to the shore by a
powerful sky-rocket properly directed?</p>

<p class='c008'>2d, By an arrow shot from a large bow of superior
force?</p>

<p class='c008'>3d, By a cord fixed to a perforated bullet, and
discharged from a musket or small piece of ordnance,
taking care to first wet the cord to prevent
its being fired by the explosion? To the end of
the small cord thus conveyed to the shore, might
be fixed a larger one, or even a rope, which, by
means of the small cord, might be drawn on board
the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>4. Might not the conveyance of one or more
cords be accomplished, with still more certainty,
from the people on shore to the distressed ship,
by means of a stout water-spaniel, or rather by a
well-trained Newfoundland-dog? These sagacious
animals are known to delight in enterprize, and
in rescuing persons in the act of drowning. Were
they once brought to encounter a rough sea, and,
with cords fastened to their collars, taught to
plunge-in at the word of command, making regular
excursions to and from the wreck, many
valuable lives might probably thus be preserved.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. In such disasters, not only the sufferers, but
spectators, are apt to lose all presence of mind;
otherwise expedients might often be contrived for
rescuing helpless mariners in their distress.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Might not Dr. Franklin’s experiment, with
a large paper-kite, deserve a trial, especially in
the direction of a fair wind and lee-shore?</p>

<p class='c008'>7. Might not a courageous rider, mounted on
a steady well-trained horse, sometimes be very useful
on these trying occasions? The horse, it
ought to be remembered, swims with his nose and
eyes just above water; but, if imprudently checked
by the bridle, it proves fatal both to him and
the rider. The heroic conduct of Cornelius Voltimed,
a Dutchman, at the Cape of Good Hope,
can never be sufficiently admired, nor his unhappy
fate too sincerely deplored. In order to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>assist fourteen persons belonging to a vessel stranded
near the coast, his intrepid philanthropy impelled
him to ride his horse repeatedly into the
sea; having at length happily succeeded in saving
all but one, his strength failed, and in his last generous
attempt to rescue that one unfortunately
lost his own life!</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dutch, in order to prevent plunder, ordain
that no person shall approach the ship on pain of
death; but this excessive zeal for the protection
of property, so truly characteristic of the nation,
generally damps every zealous effort for rescuing
the forlorn sufferers. Had, therefore, the virtuous,
the humane Voltimed even escaped the perils of
the sea, he would, nevertheless, have been tried
for his life by his unfeeling countrymen!</p>

<p class='c008'>8. Vessels being most frequently cast away on a
lee-shore, the difficulty of sending out assistance
is greatly increased by that circumstance; but,
were the sailors to fix a line to an empty cask, or
buoy, the direction of the wind and tide, being
favourable, would forcibly impel it from the
wreck towards the beach, where assistance would
be ready to fasten the line to some neighbouring
tree or post.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. But what seems to bid fairest for establishing
a line of communication with the shore, is a late
contrivance invented by Mr. Bell, of the Royal
Artillery, which, on reading the account, I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>glad to find, coincides with my own proposal,
respecting the transmission of a cord with a bullet
by gun-shot. Concerning the result of the
Experiment, the Society of Arts have published the
following favourable report:</p>

<p class='c008'>“To ascertain the merit of Mr. Bell’s invention,
his Grace the Duke of Richmond having
given directions, proper trials were accordingly
made, by throwing a loaded shell<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> on shore from
a small mortar fixed in a boat, moored in the
river Thames, above two hundred yards from
the shore. To the shell was attached a rope, one
end of which remained on board the boat. The
shell, falling about a hundred yards within land,
buried itself full eighteen inches in the gravel;
when Mr. Bell and another person, on a raft floated
by casks properly ballasted, hauled themselves
on shore in a few minutes, by means of the rope
above mentioned.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. By which is meant a shell filled with lead, to which, a
staple or ring being fixed, the rope is to be made fast. The
shell thus loaded weighed about seventy pounds, being eight
inches in diameter.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“These trials, having  been repeated three
times successively with the desired success, and it
appearing that the method, proposed by Mr. Bell,
of throwing a line on shore from a ship in distress,
either stranded, or in danger of being so, promises
to be of very important advantage to the
maritime world; as by means thereof such vessel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>may obtain relief, any person, when landed,
being enabled to secure ropes from the ship; or
additional hands may thereby be conveyed from
the shore to assist those on board. In cases of
imminent danger, moreover, where all hopes of
saving the vessel may be lost, Mr. Bell’s method
offers the most probable means of saving the crew.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Society therefore voted to Mr. Bell a
bounty of fifty guineas, on his leaving with the
Society a complete model of his contrivance;
which model is reserved in their Repository, for
the inspection and use of the Public<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>That this, or other similar inventions may prove
useful in time of need, the apparatus must be provided
beforehand; and ought to constitute a part
of the ship’s equipment previous to the voyage.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><i>New Plan for the Prevention of a Ship’s sinking.</i></h3>

<p class='c015'>A Philosophical Correspondent has favoured
me with the following communication, which displays
much ingenuity, and seems worthy of further
inquiry.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“As you wish, my dear Sir, for further intelligence,
respecting the means I should propose
for preventing ships from sinking, I will endeavour
to give you some idea of the power of the apparatus.
Its constituent parts are these:</p>

<p class='c008'>“A pair of cylindrical flexible vessels, rendered
impervious both to air and water by means
of elastic resin, and a four-barrelled pump for inflating
them. As the contents of cylinders increase
in proportion to the squares of their diameters,
such may be enlarged or diminished to
equal the power in request; consequently both
the pumps and air-vessels may be readily apportioned
to the duty they have to perform. From
the diameter of the cylinders of the pump, to
judge of their discharge, we must consider the
length of the stroke within the reach of middle-sized
men, and the number of discharges which
may be made in a given time. With the aid of
simple mechanism, I have accomplished a perpendicular
stroke of two feet, capable of being
repeated from sixty to seventy times with ease,
and from eighty to an hundred, if requested, in
a minute.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Air is a fluid of so volatile a nature, that the
slightest pressure impels it forward; four men,
therefore, can pump in more air than four hundred
men can pump out water.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“That vessels of canvas may be made, at the
same time, both flexible and air-tight, hath been
demonstratively proved already. Such vessels, in
their flaccid state, occupy little more space than a
folded sail, and consequently are stowable in a
narrow compass, till wanted. When immersed
and inflated, they remove a quantity of water adequate
to the air which they contain, and, if fixed
to a ponderous body, give it a degree of buoyancy
proportionate to the water they displace. If this
be equal to the difference in weight between that
body and an equal bulk of the fluid which surrounds
it, the whole will rest suspended even with
or near the surface of the fluid. Enlarge their
contents, and turn the balance in favour of the
sinking body, it will rise and float. Fix sufficient
buoyant powers, therefore, to the sides of a ship,
in such manner that they cannot break loose;
though a plank should start in her bottom, she
still would float.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One method, then, of preventing a ship
from sinking may be by a brace of air-vessels occasionally
lashed to her sides. Another is, that
of inflating a brace within her. To bring the
former to effect requires a more perfect knowledge
of the strength of cordage than the most
experienced rope-maker can boast. Our best
calculators egregiously err in this particular; for,
instead of its increasing in proportion to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>square<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a> of the diameter of the cordage, it comes
far nearer to the proportion of the simple diameter
only, as numerous experiments with the best new
town-made ropes of various sizes have convinced
me. In the first mode, therefore, several difficulties
remain to be overcome. The other is easy,
consisting only in the simple operation of inflating
air-vessels within her. Let such be placed in
confinement either in the hold, between the
decks, or under lashings in small open sloops (to
which your attention, Sir, seems chiefly paid), and
they will operate with the most certain and powerful
effect. For, though water, through its density,
will expel air when at liberty, it can never incroach
upon it when properly confined. Secure,
then, but a due portion of the lighter fluid in
eligible situations, and the ingress of the grosser
will be prevented. Consequently, though the sea
run mountains high, and break over the sloop
with the most tremendous surge, if the crew can
secure themselves by lashing to the mast or rigging,
and can at times have opportunity to supply
the loss of air (which, through the inaccuracy of
valves, air-cocks, &#38;c. will sometimes happen),
by a few additional strokes at the pumps, she will
continue buoyant, in spight of elements, and be
safe from the danger of sinking. Small vessels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>under such circumstances, are liable, however,
to be driven on shore; but, as they draw little
water, their crews would probably be preserved.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. See Falconer’s Marine Dictionary, article <span class='sc'>Cable</span>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“As yours, Sir, is the cause of humanity, I
have troubled you with these particulars; and
hope, that, as a possibility of relief appears, some
Philanthropic Society or other will be induced to
exert their endeavours for the preservation of the
glorious tars of Britain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As the preceding scheme is supported, by its
ingenious author, on true philosophical principles,
and seems well calculated to keep a packet boat,
or vessel of small size, buoyant, as some successful
trials on the model seem to evince; yet, as the
apparatus rests on the instable basis of air and
water, might not some difficulty arise, during a
sea storm, particularly in securing the air-cylinders,
when destined to act externally on a large
scale? It ought, therefore, to be subjected to
the test of further experiment, both internally
and externally, on vessels of different rates, as
the invention certainly merits the attention of
those who preside over maritime affairs. For,
what keeps afloat a first-rate ship of war, with
its immense freight of guns, stores, ammunition,
and men, but the difference of specific gravity
between air and water? What causes the
ship to founder, but the accidental ingress of
water, with a proportionate egress of air? Impervious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>air-vessels, therefore, properly placed,
and inflated within the ship, would prevent the
spaces thus occupied from being filled with water,
and consequently bid fair to keep her buoyant,
even though her upper deck became level with
the surface of the sea. It was thus that the ship
Guardian was prevented from foundering, whose
packages and stores containing lighter fluids, such
as spirits and air, which the water being unable to
expel, alone kept the vessel afloat. Hence appears
the utility even of empty casks if rendered
impervious and immoveably fixed between the
decks of a ship in distress.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>The importance of the Art of Swimming and Diving.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>According to the observations of a late able
writer, we are assured that, on board the King’s
ships, not half, scarcely a third part, of the crew
can swim; and that, for want of this, several, in
the course of a voyage, have been drowned<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. See Mr. Jeremy Bentham’s Inquiry on Pauper Management,
in Young’s Annals, for 1798, N<sup>o</sup> 174.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Hence perhaps may be explained why so many
sea-faring persons annually perish from shipwreck almost
close to the shore. If but few escape, even by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>swimming, it is because few British mariners are expert
swimmers; a proof that an art so necessary to all
ranks of men is too much neglected, since even
those who are destined to a seafaring-life, and to
man our fleets, are often wholly ignorant of it;
at a period too when the life of every brave soldier
or sailor is peculiarly valuable. Should it be
asked, What can the art of swimming avail when
contending armies rush to battle with the desperate
purpose to slaughter or be slaughtered? Or,
in naval conflicts, when ships and men are at once
blown into the air, or ingulphed in the bosom of
the ocean? What can it profit when Death, thus
in various shapes, sweeps away by shoals unfortunate
human beings? Is it not thus that blossoms
come forth only to be blighted? That infants
peep into existence, suffer, and die? That men,
like moths, play around the burning taper, and sink
into the flame? In short, does not all this waste
of germinating life demonstrate that it is not
individuals, but the human species, that it is not
men, but man, whose preservation is so necessary
to the completion of the grand plan of the universe?</p>

<p class='c008'>But allowing this argument its full force, it still
affords no solid objection, since it cannot be denied
that many individuals have been preserved
by swimming, who otherwise must have perished.
But of what do our fleets and armies, nay, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>whole human species consist, but of individuals?
To preserve, therefore, individuals, is virtually
to preserve and perpetuate the species, and consequently
to obey the dictates of nature, in completing
the grand system of the creation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order, then, to preserve as many individuals
as possible, the art of swimming and diving ought
to be established as an essential branch of national
education; and, that our British youth may enjoy
the same advantages which it procured to the ancient
Greeks and Romans, it would be necessary
in all sea-ports and towns bordering on large
rivers to institute schools with experienced masters
for teaching systematically the art of swimming
and diving. To execute this scheme in the
most speedy and effective manner, the illustrious
Count Berchtold recommends the establishing a
law for prohibiting Captains of vessels from engaging
sailors ignorant of swimming; and for nominating
commissioners, before whom, national
seamen should be obliged to exhibit proofs of
their progress in this art, previous to their embarkation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Formed by nature for the watery element,
fishes can with wonderful facility preserve their
equilibrium at different depths merely by contracting
or dilating their air-bladders, a curious
faculty, which, by the way, affords a beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>illustration of the efficacy of impervious air-vessels.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young of other Animals also swim spontaneously;
and though man, in consequence of
his peculiar structure, cannot swim naturally,
yet by practice he easily acquires the art, and
when once learnt, it can never be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among savage nations, the young of both
sexes are inured to this exercise from early infancy.
Hence they soon become adepts in the
art, and, regardless of a rough sea, they buffet
the billows, and brave the dangers of the deep,
which would soon swallow up less-experienced
swimmers. From their daily employment in fishing
and other aquatic expeditions, they also become
able divers. In the East Indies, the negroe
divers engaged in the pearl fisheries are
said by habit to acquire such a power of retaining
their breath as to remain under water from ten to
fifteen, nay even twenty minutes! The expert
diver therefore, in all maritime dangers, has a
decided superiority over ordinary mariners who
are novices in the art, being qualified not only to
save his own life, but that of others; and, were it
not for this, disasters from drowning would be
far more numerous than they are. The celebrated
Dr. Franklin, a most expert swimmer, declares
it to be one of the most healthy exercises in the
world. After using it an hour in the evening, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>found that he enjoyed cool refreshing sleep the
whole night, even during the most sultry heat of
summer.</p>

<p class='c008'>He mentions a curious experiment which he
tried by holding the string of a paper-kite and following
its motion whilst he floated on the surface
of the water, by which he was carried on very
pleasantly and performed his uncommon aquatic
expedition with great velocity, and without fatigue.
Nay, he thinks it not impossible to cross
the sea in this manner, from Dover to Calais,
though the packet boat, as he humourously adds,
is perhaps still preferable.</p>

<p class='c008'>In short, were swimming and diving regularly
practised by our sailors and marines, it would not
only contribute to their health and agility, but
enable them to bear the frequent vicissitudes of
heat and cold to which they are exposed; not to
mention its known efficacy in curing inveterate
diarrhœas and other obstinate chronic discharges,
to which they are liable.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would also qualify them to encounter, without
fear, a rough sea, with a lee-shore, for the purpose
of fixing a line of communication with the
coast. In this hazardous enterprize might not a
paper-kite help to waft them through the stormy
waves? In case of a naval victory, an experienced
diver is enabled to plunge boldly into the deep to
recover important dispatches thrown overboard in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the heat of an engagement, or with equal alacrity
in the moment of victory, to rescue the enemy
in the act of drowning<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a>. For it has ever been the
glory and delight of an English seaman, expert
in this noble art, to hazard his own life to save
not only a friend but even an enemy, of which our
naval history affords many illustrious examples.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. In the Philosophical Magazine, vol. III. is described a
new diving machine, in which the diver can, at 60 feet under
water, view objects around him, and go directly to the particular
spot. In searching, therefore, for a person drowned,
this would seem far preferable to the present uncertain mode
of using drags or nets.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Such transcendant acts of bravery and disinterested
generosity deservedly render them dear
to their country, and the admiration of their
enemies!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>Asylum for Shipwrecked Mariners.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I cannot finally dismiss the present subject
without testifying my surprise that, amid the numerous
charitable institutions established in Great
Britain, which at once proclaim the opulence,
the generosity, and the benevolence of the inhabitants,
there should still be wanting one provision,
of all others the most necessary, <i>viz.</i> a
temporary Asylum, or house of reception for
shipwrecked mariners; where, for a few nights,
they might be provided with dry clothes, warm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>beds, proper diet, and other necessaries. For
what avails it to have escaped the dangers of the
sea, if left to wander friendless and unknown, and
at last to perish on a strange coast?</p>

<p class='c008'>Therefore such an asylum, ever ready to open
its friendly doors to distressed mariners of all nations,
ought to be erected wherever the coast is
peculiarly dangerous, where disasters most frequently
happen, and where accommodations are
most difficult to be obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may not be improper to add that the expence
of building and supporting such asylums, though
very considerable, ought in no wise to be
deemed an insuperable objection. This might
be defrayed by a small county rate, that would
be scarcely felt by individuals, nay would be
“lighter than the dust of the balance” when put
in competition with the important object of preserving
the lives of gallant seamen, and of administering
comfort to unfortunate persons destitute
of every thing, and ready to perish!</p>

<p class='c008'>An object indeed, whether considered in a
moral, a commercial, or a political view, cannot
but be esteemed peculiarly interesting to the community,
and consequently intituled to the attention
of the legislature; since to British seamen this
maritime country is principally indebted not only
for its commerce, but its protection.</p>

<p class='c008'>On whom can the Civic Crown be more properly
bestowed than on those active and humane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>individuals who, through mechanical ingenuity,
or personal bravery, rescue their distressed fellow-creatures
from the disasters of the deep, and restore
them to their families, their friends and
their country? “Nulla enim re homines propius
accedunt ad Deos, quam salutem hominibus
dando.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Since writing the above, I have been favoured
with the following letter concerning an excellent
institution of this kind, established, some time
ago, under the auspices of the benevolent Dr.
Sharpe, late Archdeacon of Northumberland. The
plan being unique in its kind, and comprehensive
in its nature, bids fair to realize every advantage
that could be wished, and therefore cannot
but afford sincere pleasure to every humane
reader.</p>

      <div class='line'>“SIR,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“From the many shipwrecks which have happened
on our coasts, during the last year, and
the number of lives and aggregate of property
which must consequently have been lost, it is
highly desirable that some mode should be adopted
of lessening the dangers which so frequently menace
such vessels as approach the rocky shores of
these kingdoms, in boisterous and stormy weather.
Each succeeding winter swells the melancholy
list of sufferers, and increases the numbers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>of those who have to mourn their relatives and
friends, torn from them by the fury of the tempest.
For this reason, I am anxious to lay before
you, as a distinguished member of the Humane
Society, the following short account of a very
laudable plan that ought to be more generally
known.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'><i>Humane Institution at Bamborough Castle for the preservation of lives and property from Shipwreck. Signals from the Castle.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>1st, “A great gun, a nine-pounder, placed at
the bottom of the tower, to be fired in case any
vessel be observed in distress; and the signal to be
varied according to circumstances, in order that
the Custom-house officers may hasten to give all
possible assistance, as well as to prevent the wreck
from being plundered.</p>

<p class='c008'>2d, In every great storm, two men on horseback
are sent from the castle, to patrole along the
coast from sun-set to sun-rise, that, in case of an
accident, one may remain by the vessel, and the
other return to alarm the castle. Whoever brings
the first notice of the distress is entitled to a premium,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>in proportion to the distance from the
castle.</p>

<p class='c008'>3d, A large flag is hoisted when, on the Fern
islands, any vessel is seen in distress, that the
sufferers may have the satisfaction of knowing
their disaster is perceived from the shore, and
that relief will be sent to them as soon as possible.
In tempestuous weather, the flag will be
kept up; a gun fired morning and evening,
and a sky-rocket thrown up, every night, from
the North turret, till such time as relief can be
sent.</p>

<p class='c008'>These are also signals to the Holy Island fishermen
who, by the advantage of their situation,
can put off for the islands at times when no boat
from the main land can get over the breakers.
Premiums are given to the first boat which puts
off for the islands, with suitable necessaries and
provisions.</p>

<p class='c008'>4th, A bell on the South turret will be rung
in every thick fog, as a signal to the fishing-boats.</p>

<p class='c008'>5th, A large weathercock is fixed on the top of
the flag-staff, for the use of the pilots.</p>

<p class='c008'>6th, A large speaking-trumpet is provided to
be used when vessels are stranded, or in distress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>near the shore, of which there have been many
instances<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. The patent signal trumpet (lately invented by Mr. Fitzgerald),
to which a pistol or piece of ordnance can be screwed,
is said to increase sound to such a pitch as to render the report
of a common cartridge, fired through it, equal to that
of a nine-pounder. Such an instrument therefore may prove
highly useful to mariners in distress. Repertory of Arts,
Vol. XI. p. 100.</p>

<p class='c008'>As might also the Telegraph, which is now so much
improved as to give signals by night, as well as by
day.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>7th, An observatory is erected at the East turret
of the castle, where a person is stationed
every morning at day-break, in the winter season,
to watch the adjacent coast, for vessels in
distress.</p>

<p class='c008'>8th, Masters and commissioners of vessels in
distress are requested to make such signals as
are usual among persons in their unhappy situation.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>The additional accommodations, supplied at this asylum, are</h3>

<p class='c018'>“1st, Rooms and beds for shipwrecked mariners,
who will be maintained in the castle a week,
or longer, according to circumstances; and during
the whole time provided with all manner of
necessaries.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>2d, Cellars for wine and other liquors belonging
to shipwrecked vessels, in which they will be
safely deposited for one year, in order to be
claimed by their proper owners.</p>

<p class='c017'>3d, A store-house for the reception of all
manner of goods, stores, or implements belonging
to a ship recovered from the wreck. They
will be entered in a book kept for that purpose,
giving the marks and description of each,
with the date when they came on shore.</p>

<p class='c017'>4. Timber, blocks, tackles, handspikes, rudders,
cables, ropes, pumps, and iron, all in readiness,
for the use of wrecked vessels, and delivered
at prime-cost.</p>

<p class='c017'>5. Various implements for raising and weighing
stranded vessels, even of 1000 tons burthen, when
sunk on rocks, or in deep water; to be lent,
gratis, to any person having occasion for them,
within forty or fifty miles along the coast, on
giving proper security to re-deliver them to the
trustees.</p>

<p class='c017'>6. Whenever dead bodies are cast on shore,
coffins, and the whole funeral expences, will be
provided, gratis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Such a scheme of disinterested benevolence,
supported by princely munificence, and carried
on in an obscure corner of the island, without ostentation,
is far above all praise! When more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>fully known, it surely cannot fail to awaken emulation,
and give birth to similar asylums in this,
and other maritime nations. For the whole community
is interested in promoting it, and particularly
all commercial companies, ship-owners,
and insurers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, in order to establish an institution of this
sort, two methods present themselves: Public
Benevolence; or, an Act of the Legislature, levying
a small tax upon all vessels. For the execution
of so extensive an undertaking, the latter seems
preferable.</p>

<p class='c008'>By such an act, commissioners should be appointed
in London, and in all the maritime counties,
under whose care the management of the different
asylums ought to be conducted. The expence
of each building, on a smaller scale, need
not to exceed four hundred pounds. A serjeant’s
guard, drafted from the neighbouring military,
should be regularly quartered at each station, to
preserve order, and drive away plunderers. The
neighbouring fishermen and inhabitants might be
formed into a company, to assist on every emergency,
and to be rewarded according to their
exertions. The family of one of these might be
allowed to reside in the house, rent-free, to keep
every thing in due order. At each station an
exact register ought to be kept of every vessel
stranded, the articles saved, the names and places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of abode of the crews and passengers, &#38;c. This
register, at the close of the year, ought to be
transmitted to the Commissioners in London, under
whose inspection the particulars ought to be
published, for the satisfaction of parties concerned,
and to enable the public to estimate the utility
of the institution, and induce neighbouring nations
to imitate the plan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having now extended this voyage of observation
beyond its original destination, behold new
objects present themselves to view, which solicit
my attention. Being as yet, however, only a
fresh sailor, and my vessel but indifferently
rigged, I must forbear launching into a wider
sea: shall hasten, therefore, to steer my little
bark into the friendly port to which it is bound.</p>
